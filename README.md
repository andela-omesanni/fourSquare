DISCOVERING PLACES IN LAGOS THROUGH FOUR SQUARE (6TH ANDELA PROJECT)


********************************************** DESCRIPTION ******************************************************

This project was to allow people who are new to lagos or who don't know lagos well enough to discover places within the city.
Users can discover places in Lagos under categories such as food, drinks, shops, arts, outdoors and sights. Users can also 
view these places on the map and get directions to these places from their address.
This project was done using JQuery, Four Square API and Google Maps API.

********************************************** THINGS LEARNT  ***************************************************

Learnt the ins and outs of four square and google maps api. Again, I improved my design and user experience skills. It is
important to know what design works best and which doesn't as I had to think in terms of the users making use of the app
and not terms of a programmer's frame of mind.
